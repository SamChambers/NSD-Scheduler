# NSD-Scheduler
Python script to parse weekly schedule emails from Gingr and reply with ICS file attachment to import shifts into calendar.


Needed python3 modules:

icalendar (sudo pip3 install icalendar)
pytz (sudo pip3 install pytz)

Privacy
This script does NOT collect or store ANY data. It only has access to data you provide (email address, name, schedule). The script does not automatically delete received and sent emails, so anything you send to/receive from nsd.scheduler@gmail.com will also be in that email's inbox/sent folders. Nothing is ever done with any information.
